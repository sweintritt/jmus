# ToDo

* If the terminal window is too small the app crashes
* Show column headers
* Show year and genre
* Configurable Columns?
* Use Github for Issues?
* Sort files to switch between random and non-random. Every should get an index,
  so that switching between those modes still means you can go back to your last played song.
* Implement (f)ind. Filter the song list based on user input and select songs
  from that list.
* Show help page with (h)
* Write unittests and make the app more testable
