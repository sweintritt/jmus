ToDo
=====

* Clear screen on quit
* Use Github for Issues?
* Sort files to switch between random and non-random. Every should get an index,
  so that switching between those modes still means you can go back to your last played song.
* Do not display the last played songs, but the song list.
* Implement (f)ind. Filter the song list based on user input and select songs 
  from that list.
* Write unittests and make the app more testable
* Sometimes no metadata are shown while playing until you skip to the next song
* Sometimes the app crashes
* Implement a "back" command
  * Files and metadata could be stored instead of just the title line
